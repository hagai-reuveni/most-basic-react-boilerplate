## This is a 'most basic' react setup for workshops and courses I'm running.
_This includes only the bare essentials  (webpack with dev. server, babel, react, sass etc.)_

### Branches:
* [Only bare essentials](https://github.com/hagai-reuveni/most-basic-react-boilerplate/tree/bare-essentials)
* [With Sass](https://github.com/hagai-reuveni/most-basic-react-boilerplate/tree/add-sass)
