## This is a 'most basic' react setup for workshops and courses I'm running.
___This includes only the bare essentials  (webpack with dev. server, babel, react, sass etc.).___

_This repo is being used as a seed for my react workshops and courses. Please do not use it 'as is' for production.
__Note:__ I'm using '^' for the packages as it is only a boilerplate._

### Branches:
* [Only bare essentials](https://github.com/hagai-reuveni/most-basic-react-boilerplate/tree/bare-essentials)
* [With Sass](https://github.com/hagai-reuveni/most-basic-react-boilerplate/tree/add-sass)
